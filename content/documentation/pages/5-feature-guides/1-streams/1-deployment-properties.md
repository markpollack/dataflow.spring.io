When the stream is deployed to the target deployment platforms `Local`, `CloudFoundry` and `Kubernetes`, you can provide the configuration properties that are applied to the stream applications at deployment time.
For instance,

- you can specify how many instances of the individual applications in the streaming pipeline
- you can specify resource requirements for the individual applications on the target platform
