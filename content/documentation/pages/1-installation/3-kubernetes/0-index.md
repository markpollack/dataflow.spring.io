# Installation

This section covers the installation Data Flow on Kubernetes using the Helm chart as well as using `kubectl`.

This guide also describes setting up an environment for testing Spring Cloud Data Flow on the Google Kubernetes Engine and is not meant to be a definitive guide for setting up a production environment.
You can adjust the suggestions to fit your test setup.
Remember that a production environment requires much more consideration for persistent storage of message queues, high availability, security, and other concerns.
Refer to [this section](/documentation/installation/kubernetes/creating-a-cluster) for some high level guidance for creating a Kubernetes cluster.
